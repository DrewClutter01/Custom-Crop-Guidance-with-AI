This project aims to help farmers maximize their crop yields by understanding each crop's specific needs and nutrients. We used the "Crop recommendation" dataset from Kaggle to gather our data and findings. We utilized the Logistic Regression and Random forest classifier to tackle our problem. 

### Business Understanding and Data Understanding
The data set was entirely composed of numerical data

Key Factors: Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium 
Environmental Variables: Temperature, Humidity, pH_Value, Rainfall
Target Variables: Crop
 
 
### Modeling and Evaluation
We recommend for our client to use the logistic regression model. It preformed quite well, 98% accuracy on the dedicated testing data. This model also showcased 100% accuracy achieved in 4 specific clusters, indicating perfect classification for those clusters. Additionally,l ogistic regression models are quicker to train and make predictions than random forest classifiers

### Conclusion 
We recommend that our client use the logistic regression model. It performed quite well, achieving 98% accuracy on the dedicated testing data. This model also showcased 100% accuracy in four specific clusters, indicating perfect classification for those clusters. Additionally, logistic regression models are quicker to train and make predictions than random forest classifiers.
