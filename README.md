Custom Crop Guidance with AI

The "Custom Crop Guidance with AI" project aims to help farmers maximize their crop yields by understanding each crop's specific needs and nutrients. We used the Crop recommendation dataset to gather our data and findings. We utilized the Logistic Regression and Random forest classifier to tackle our problem.

### Modeling and Evaluation
We recommend for our client to use the logistic regression model. It preformed quite well, 98% accuracy on the dedicated testing data. This model also showcased 100% accuracy achieved in 4 specific clusters, indicating perfect classification for those clusters. Additionally,l ogistic regression models are quicker to train and make predictions than random forest classifiers
