### Modeling and Evaluation
We recommend for our client to use the logistic regression model. It preformed quite well, 98% accuracy on the dedicated testing data. This model also showcased 100% accuracy achieved in 4 specific clusters, indicating perfect classification for those clusters. Additionally,l ogistic regression models are quicker to train and make predictions than random forest classifiers
